Activities
==========


An important part of a successful customer relations process is clear and timely communications between all the 
stakeholders. OroCRM's provides a number of tools to enable them.
Calendars will ensure the users are aware of their tasks, of the events that have to attend and issues they have to 
solve.
With activities you can create, track and update customer-related activities such as phone calls, emails, tasks, 
calendar events, and more.
