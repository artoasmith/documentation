4. Click **Additional** and specify the following:

   - **Description**—Type the description of this role. Use the in-built text editor to format the provided description.
   
   - **Organization**—Select the organization for user's of which this role will be applicable. If you want this role to be applicable for all organizations defined in the system, do not specify any organization. In this case the field value becomes **System-wide.** (If there is only a single organization defined in the system or you do not have global access rights, there will be no option for selecting an organization.)

For more information about the access levels, see the :ref:`Access Levels <access-management--access-level>` guide.
