Access and Permissions Basics
------------------------------

The functionality built within OroCRM can enhance your CRM process. However, different members of the team will require 
different information and tools. For instance, the needs of marketing associates are different from those of support 
teams or company management. Because of this, OroCRM allows a good deal of flexibility when it comes to adjusting access 
and permission settings. This helps to ensure that all information is safe but still easily available. All users will be 
able to use the features and capabilities that they require. 

This guide will explain the basic ideas that make up the access and permission settings. If you are the system 
administrator, please address the :ref:`Access and Permissions Management <user-guide-user-management-permissions>`
guide.


Log Actions in the System
-------------------------

Whether a workflow has been defined for entity records, or users can process it in any order, it is important to know 
what actions have been performed with a record, as well as by whom. Who has turned this cart into an order? Who has 
closed an opportunity? Who has deleted a customer? Who has changed contact details? In order to know the answers, you 
can use OroCRM's data audit functionality

A detailed description of the data audit functionality is available in the :ref:`History of Changes <user-guide-change-history>` 
guide.
