Create Opportunities
--------------------

.. begin_create_an_opportunity

Opportunities can be related to any customer type: Magento, OroCommerce or customers introduced by various third-party extensions. Business customers will remain available as legacy for users who upgrade from OroCRM 1.10 edition but will be deprecated in OroCRM 2.0.

Opportunities can also be :ref:`related directly to accounts <user-guide-opportunities-create--relate-to-account>`.  This is the simplest OroCRM setup if you do not need to track multi-channel sales. You can always enable the additional complexity of multiple customer channels when the need arises.

You can create opportunities from all related entities (e.g., from :ref:`OroCommerce customer <user-guide-opportunities-create--from-orocommerce-customer>`, from :ref:`Magento customer <user-guide-opportunities-create--from-magento-customer>` view or :ref:`account <user-guide-opportunities-create--from-account>` view), :ref:`by converting a lead to an opportunity <user-guide-opportunities-create--convert-lead-to-opportunity>` and :ref:`by creating an opportunity manually <user-guide-opportunities-create--create-manually>`.

You can also delete the entered phone, email or address by clicking **X** on the right of the corresponding fields (as shown in the screenshot below).

.. _user-guide-opportunities-create--relate-to-account:

Relate Opportunity to an Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Opportunities can be related to any customer type, e-commerce or not, such as Magento, Prestashop, OroCommerce and such like.
In the simplest OroCRM setup, when you do not need the complexity of multi-channel sales, opportunities can be related directly to accounts. In this context, it is not recommended to use customers when selecting an account in the Opportunity Information form, since your customers will be represented by an account entity.

You can search for an account or create a new one.


.. image:: ../../../img/opportunities_2.0/plus_button_account.jpg


.. image:: ../../../img/opportunities_2.0/account_related_opportunity.jpg

Account view page will display opportunities related to a particular account in the **Action** section. :term:`Lifetime Sales Value` will be calculated based on the values of the opportunities related to an account.

.. image:: ../../../img/opportunities_2.0/account_view_page_opp.jpg



Let us have a look at a more complex context when you need to track multi-channel sales. For instance, if you have different Magento stores and different Magento customers in every store and you wish to track your sales via sales opportunities and create opportunities related to specific Magento customers. In the following example, we have created a new opportunity related to a Magento customer:


.. image:: ../../../img/opportunities_2.0/account_magento_customer.jpg


In the **Account** dropdown, you will see groups of accounts and customers. Each group will have at least one account. The types of the customers displayed in the dropdown will depend on the active channels in your system. The customers will be identified by the corresponding logo.

In the given example, there is an option to relate the opportunity to an *A.L.Price account* and the customer (from 2 Magento channels) that belongs to the account.

Accounts can be searched for not only by their account name but also contact name, email or phone.

.. image:: ../../../img/opportunities_2.0/account_search_by_contact.jpg



Once saved, this opportunity will be related to an account via a customer.
