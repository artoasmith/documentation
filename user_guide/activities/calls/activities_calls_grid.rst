Page Top
^^^^^^^^

On the upper-left of the page, you can see the name of the selected grid view. The only grid view available by default for calls is **All Calls** (all available calls are displayed).

In the upper-right part of the page you can see the :guilabel:`Log Call` action button. Click it to make or log a call. See the :ref:`Log a Call <doc-activities-calls-actions-log>` and :ref:`Make a Call <doc-activities-calls-actions-make>` action descriptions.

The other grid controls are common for all grids in the application. See the :ref:`Grids <user-guide-ui-components-grids>` guide for more information on grids.
