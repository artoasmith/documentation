Modify Segments
"""""""""""""""
To modify the ranking table with your data, specify the following information for each segment:

    -  **Recency** shows the number of days since the last order made by a customer. Measured in days. The fewer days has passed, the better must be the score.
    
    -  **Frequency** shows the total number of orders a customer made during the last 365 days. The more orders, the better must be the score.)
    
    -  **Monetary value** shows the total amount of money spent during the last 365 days. The more is spent, the better must be the score.

.. note::
    Note the following:

        -  Score 1 is considered the best.
        
        -  You need to specify only one of the thresholds, the other is filled in automatically.
