User Access Settings
=====================

.. contents:: :local:
    :depth: 3


Overview
--------

*Which organization and / or business unit a user has access to?*

User's access settings is one of the most important points in determining which data the user will be able to access. The organizations you are selecting in this section are organizations a user can log into. Both organizations and business units selected are records which data owned by a user will belong to. 

.. Caution:: 
  Pay attention that if a user looses access to certain organization, the data the user owns that was created for this organization, stays in organization. If a user looses access to a business unit, the data the user owns becomes unavailable in this business unit. For details, see the :ref:`Examples <access-management--examples>` section.
