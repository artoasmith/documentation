User View Page

.. contents:: :local:
    :depth: 3


Description
-------------

Top of the page
"""""""""""""""

On the upper-left of the page, you can see the user's avatar, their full name and statuses.

The first status shows whether the user is enabled (i.e. the user is granted rights to use the system) or disabled.

The second status is called ``authentication status`` and defines the state of the user's password. The authentication status can be one of the following:

- **Active**—The user can use their password to log into the system.
- **Password reset**—The password reset link has been sent to the user, but the user is still is in the process of the password change. This status appears not only when password is being manually reset. The user will receive this authentication status when their password has expired—in this case the system automatically starts the password reset procedure.
- **Locked**—(EE only) The user has exceeded allowed number of failed login attempts.

In the next row you can check when the user's record was created, updated. Also, there is information about the date and time when the user last logged in and how many times they logged into OroCRM in general.

Click this button to activate the user. See the :ref:`Activate a User <doc-user-management-users-actions-activate>` action description.

:guilabel:`Disable User` / :guilabel:`Enable User`— Which of these two buttons appears depends on the current user status, whether the user is enabled or disabled.
