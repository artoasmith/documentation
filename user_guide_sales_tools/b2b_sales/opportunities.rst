Opportunities
=============


Overview
--------

Opportunities are highly probable potential or actual sales to a new or established customer. Request for proposal, invitation for a bidding, agreement of intentions or order for a delivery can be saved as opportunities.

In order to add and process details of opportunities in OroCRM, you need to have at least one :term:`channel <Channel>` to which the opportunity entity :ref:`can be assigned <user-guide-channel-guide-entities>`.

Create Opportunities
--------------------

You can create opportunities in two ways, by converting a lead to an opportunity and by creating a lead manually.

Convert Lead To Opportunity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As soon as a lead is ready to be qualified, it can be converted into an opportunity.

This can be done by:

-  Navigating to **Sales>Leads** in the main menu.

-  Opening a lead from the grid.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/convert_to_opportunity_button.png

|


-  Clicking **Convert Lead to Opportunity** on the lead page.

-  **Convert Lead To Opportunity** form will emerge.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/convert_to_opportunity.png

|




More information on leads can be found in the :ref:`Leads <user-guide-system-channel-entities-leads>` guide.

Create Opportunity Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create an opportunity manually:

-  Go to **Sales>Opportunities** in the main menu.

-  Click **Create Opportunity** in the top right corner.

-  The **Create Opportunity form** will appear.

|                           | E.g. If the predicted budget was $10 000 but the result of the deal was $500 lower than the budget amount, the close revenue would constitute $9 500.   |

| **Close Reason**          | The reason for closing the deal, e.g. won, outsold, cancelled, etc.                                                                                     |

| **Additional Comments**   | Enter additional comments if necessary.                                                                                                                 |
+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

**New Contact Information Form** contains **General**, **Contact Details**, and **Addresses** sections with a number of fields to fill in.

Since the lead has fulfilled its purpose and is no longer needed, a new contact will be created based on lead data entered in this form.

It is possible to enter multiple phones, emails and addresses for an
opportunity. You can choose which phone, email or address is to be
primary. You can also delete the entered phone, email or address by
clicking X on the right of the corresponding fields (as shown in the
screenshot below).

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/contact_info_form_1.png

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/contact_info_form_2.png

|




.. note::  Within the opportunity grid, however, only one phone, email and address will be displayed, even if multiple phones, emails and addresses were entered.
 
 
Once you have completed filling in the forms, click **Save and Close**
to save the opportunity in the system.

Create an Opportunity Form
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Instead of converting a lead to an opportunity, you can manually create
a new opportunity:

-  Navigate to **Sales>Opportunities**.

-  Click **Create Opportunity** in the top right corner of the page.

-  A **Create Opportunity form** will open with fields to define.

.. note:: Note that the **Create an Opportunity** page is essentially the same as **Convert To Opportunity** page but it does not contain **New Contact Information** section.



|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/create_opportunity_form.png

|



The **General** fields in Create and Opportunity form are the same as
**Opportunity Information** fields in Convert To Opportunity form. More
information on filling in the form can be found in the Convert To
Opportunity Form section of this guide.

Manage Opportunities 
---------------------

The following actions can be performed for opportunities from the grid:

-  Export and import opportunity record details with Export and Import buttons as described in the :ref:`Export and Import Functionality <user-guide-import>` guide.

-  Delete an opportunity from the system : |IcDelete|

-  Edit the opportunity : |IcEdit|

-  View the opportunity : |IcView|

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/edit_opp_from_grid.png

|



Multiple Grid Views
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Multiple grid views are available for opportunities:

-  All opportunities.

-  Open Opportunities.

-  Overdue Opportunities.

-  Recently Closed Opportunities.

**Open Opportunities** grid is the default view.

To change the grid view, click on the arrow icon on the right of Open
Opportunities header and select the preferred grid view from the
dropdown, as shown in the screenshot below.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/multiple_grid_views.png

|



Inline Editing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inline editing within the grid can help you amend opportunity details without opening the edit opportunity form. To edit opportunities from the grid, double-click on the field or the edit
icon in the field you wish to edit.

|

|




Kanban Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~

As an alternative to grid view, it is possible to view Opportunities in
Kanban board. To change grid view to board view, open **Grid/Board
menu** and click **Board**.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/kanban_icon.png

|

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/kanban_view.png

|




.. note:: Kanban board functionality is available only if **Opportunities Management Flow** is **disabled** in **System>Workflows**.
 
   

Within the board, you can:

-  Change opportunities status by dragging them between columns.
 
|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/draggin_opportunity_kanban.png

|



-  Delete an opportunity from the system : |IcDelete|

-  Edit an opportunity : |IcEdit|

-  View an opportunity : |IcView|

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/edit_opp_kanban.png

|



.. note:: Inline editing feature is not available for board view, it is only possible within the grid view.
 
  
Manage Opportunity Workflow
---------------------------

You can use OroCRM’s :term:`workflows <Workflow>` to define rules and guidelines on possible actions/updates of opportunities in the system. You can read more on :ref:`workflows <user-guide-workflow-management>`.

Activate Opportunity Management Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To ensure data consistency and reasoned opportunity management by a
sales manager, you can activate Opportunity Management Flow in
**System>Workflows**. This can be done in two ways:

-  From the grid: click **V** in the ellipsis menu

-  From the view page: open Opportunity Management Flow view page and
   click **Activate** in the top right corner.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/opp_managenent_flow_grid.png

|

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/activate_workflow.png

|




Active Opportunity Management Flow limits what a sales manager can do
with opportunities, thus eliminating situations when, for instance, an
opportunity is not yet closed but its close reason is specified, or an
opportunity is closed but its close reason is unspecified.

Start Opportunity Management Flow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Activating Opportunity Management Flow does not happen automatically for
all opportunities. Once the flow has been activated in
**System>Workflows**, you need to start it manually for the required
opportunities.


|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/start_workflow_manually.png

|


You can set Opportunity Status and Probability manually before starting
Opportunity Management Flow.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/start_workflow_manually_popup.png

|



Transitions
~~~~~~~~~~~

Three transitions will become available as the result of flow
activation:

-  Develop

-  Close As Won

-  Close As Lost

Close As Won/Close As Lost
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Close Revenue** and **Close Reason** fields and statuses have become
unavailable in the edit opportunity form as the result of flow
activation.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/closed_statuses_inactive.png

|



To close an opportunity as Won or Lost, use **Close As Won/Close As
Lost** transition buttons instead. They are located at the top of
Opportunities view page.

|

.. image:: /img/opportunities/opp_flow_activated.png

|



Note that it is not possible to close an opportunity from the grid,
although inline editing as a feature is available after flow activation.

To close an opportunity as Won:

-  Click **Close As Won** button.

-  Enter Close Revenue.

-  Enter Expected Close Date.

-  Click **Submit.**

To close an opportunity as Lost:

-  Click **Close As Lost** button.

-  Select Close Reason from the dropdown.

-  Select the Expected Close Date.

-  Click **Submit**.

Develop
^^^^^^^

**Develop** transition is a simplified form for editing an opportunity.
